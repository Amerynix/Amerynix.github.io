        <p>By the late 1800's, America was experiencing mass immigration, as an increasing amount of immigrants bought into the American dream narrative. Events like the gold rush in California for example, presented America to be filled with economical oppertunities that were particularly appealing to Chinese immigrants who were growing disatisfied with China's economic situation. Racial discrimination was extremely prevalent in the US, and it was only perpetuated by the competition for jobs between Chinese immigrants and white laborers, especially as the country was experiencing post Civil War econimic decline and crises.The mob violences and rampant discrimination pushed the Chinese immigrants to create their own Chinese communities, such as Chinatown. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 slowed down Chinese immigration. </p>
